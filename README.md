I. Abstract


Each year NeighborhoodScout releases a comprehensive ranked list of the most dangerous cities
in America. Their list is based on the number of reported violent crimes per 1,000 residents.
Violent crimes include murder, rape, armed robbery and aggravated assault. In 2018, Washington
DC ranked as the 41st most dangerous city in America. Additionally, DC was given a crime
index of 3, indicating it is safer than just 3% of US cities with a 1 in 83 chance of being a victim
of a violent crime at any given time (Schiller, 2018). In order to reduce crime authorities have put
great effort into tracking the prevalence and details of crimes in major metropolitan areas across
the country in order to determine how to best allocate resources. Washington DC’s Metropolitan
Police Department employs an advanced system of crime data collection and reporting
(Metropolitan Police Department, 2018). Regardless of resources, data, or awareness it isn’t
possible to predict when and where a crime will occur, or if it will happen to you. Team Safety
Recommender decided that it is possible to increase risk awareness and help DC residents and
nonresidents make informed decisions about specific location based on historical crime data. The
goal of the data product is to provide a tool that will help consumers discern the safety level of a
particular location by predicting the type of crime that may occur in the near future.
